	abstract = {This systematic review examines the effectiveness of videos in modifying health behaviors. We searched PubMed (1975–2012), PsycINFO (1975–2012), EMBASE (1975–2012), and CINAHL (1983–2012) for controlled clinical trials that examined the effectiveness of video interventions in changing health behaviors. Twenty-eight studies comprised of 12,703 subjects were included in the systematic review. Video interventions were variably effective for modifying health behaviors depending on the target behaviors to be influenced. Video interventions appear to be effective in breast self-examination, prostate cancer screening, sunscreen adherence, self-care in patients with heart failure, HIV testing, treatment adherence, and female condom use. However, videos have not shown to be effective in influencing addiction behaviors when they are not tailored. Compared to loss-framing, gain-framed messages may be more effective in promoting certain types of health behavior change. Also, video modeling may facilitate learning of new behaviors and can be an important consideration in future video interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Globally, suboptimal dietary choices are a leading cause of noncommunicable diseases. Evidence for effective interventions to address these behaviors, particularly in young adults, is limited. Given the substantial time young adults spend in using social media, there is interest in understanding the current and potential role of these platforms in shaping dietary behavior.
Objective: This study aims to explore the influence of social media on young adults’ dietary behaviors.
Methods: We recruited 234 young adults aged 18-24 years and living in Australia, using market and social research panels. We applied a digital ethnography approach to collect data from web-based conversations in a series of forums, where participants responded to different health-themed questions related to health behavior change and persuasion on social media. We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis.
Results: Participants described how social media influenced their decisions to change their health behaviors. Access to social support and health information through web-based communities was juxtaposed with exposure to highly persuasive fast-food advertisements. Some participants expressed that exposure to web-based health-focused content induced feelings of guilt about their behavior, which was more prominent among women. Fast-food advertisements were discussed as a contributor to poor health behaviors and indicated as a major barrier to change.
Conclusions: Young adults reported that social media is highly persuasive toward dietary behavior through different pathways of social influence. This suggests that social norms on the web are an important aspect of changing young adults’ health behaviors. The commercialization of social media also encourages poor health behaviors, largely through fast-food advertisements. Future social media–delivered dietary interventions should acknowledge the social and environmental factors that challenge the ability of young adults to make individual health behavior improvements. Care should also be taken to ensure that future interventions do not further elicit guilt in a way that contributes to poor mental health within this community.},

	abstract = {How best to deliver healthy-eating education through social media among a low-income population remains understudied. To assess the impact of the Cooking Matters (CM) Facebook page on healthy eating behaviors among low-income caregivers, we conducted a pre–post survey of new CM Facebook followers in early 2020. A convenience sample was recruited at baseline from WICShopper app users and the CM Facebook page. The recruited sample included 397 low-income caregivers of a child younger than 6 who never followed CM Facebook. Among the baseline caregivers, 184 completed the follow-up survey. Paired t-test and McNemar–Bowker tests were conducted to compare the outcomes pre- and post-following CM Facebook. A binary indicator was developed to measure whether the outcomes were improved (1 = Improved; 0 = Not improved). Multi-variable logistic regressions were applied to examine the relationship between whether the outcome was improved with reference to the baseline socio-demographics. No significant differences were detected between pre and post outcomes overall (p {\textgreater} 0.05), except improvement in feeding healthy meals within the budget available (p {\textless} 0.05). However, improvement in select outcomes was more significant in men and single-parent households. The CM Facebook page could be an important platform to influence low-income caregivers of young children.},

	abstract = {Social media influencers have gained significant popularity particularly within marketing research. However, their impact extends beyond purchase decision making, as they also have the potential to influence attitudes and behaviors through the lifestyles they promote in their content. This study aims to explore the role of influencers in promoting healthier habits, with a specific focus on home-cooking. By investigating how influencers can generate vicarious experiences through recipe content, we aim to understand their impact on individuals’ intentions to cook at home. Grounded in social influence theory, we build an original research model that we evaluate using self-reported data obtained from 213 French female social media users and the partial least squares approach. The findings of our study reveal that positive vicarious experiences are driven by the followers’ parasocial relationship with influencers, a sense of social belonging, and the entertainment factor of the observed behavior. These experiences help shaping followers’ intentions to imitate the influencer’s behavior, such as cooking the recipes they propose. Additionally, we found that the attractiveness of the recipes, the followers’ inclination towards novelty seeking, and their own cooking experience all contribute positively influencing this intention. Overall, our study sheds light on the ability of influencers to exert influence beyond purchase intentions. They possess the power to make a positive impact on their followers’ behavior by providing an immersive vicarious experiences and encouraging a shift towards healthier habits, such as home-cooking.},

Cognitions and behavior related to healthy eating and cooking were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-week follow-up.Results of mixed-effects modeling indicated that participants randomized to the video condition reported significantly greater post-intervention intentions to cook (p \&lt; .001), which positively correlated with cooking behavior over the subsequent week (p \&lt; .01). There was no effect of the II intervention on subsequent-week behavior (ps \&gt; .413). Importantly, 75\% (n = 105) indicated experiencing food insecurity at the time of data collection.These results highlight a promising pathway for improving nutrition and diet-related health outcomes among Black Americans while highlighting that any intervention must account for food insecurity in this population.Non-Hispanic Black Americans experience the highest, and most rapidly increasing, rates of obesity and diseases attributed at least in part to poor diet quality.

	abstract = {Purpose
The present study conducted a social media content analysis on videos describing the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) posted onYouTube.
Setting
YouTube TM online video sharing and social media platform.
Method
Three independent content experts evaluated 141 YouTube videos on the MedDiet in August 2020 utilizing standard rubric and protocol. Data abstracted include media source(s) of posted videos, and viewer exposure/engagement metrics. Information quality was measured by each content expert independently through use of the DISCERN instrument, a 16-item tool designed to assess reliability, dependability, and trustworthiness of an online source, scores were then aggregated for analysis.
Results
A majority of videos (n = 102, 72.3\%) were educational in nature. A third of videos were less clear and less credible on information presented (n = 46, 32.6\%). Most videos were posted by an individual (n = 79, 56\%), and the majority of videos were rated as medium quality (n = 88, 62.4\%). Overall level of user engagement as measured by number of “likes,” “dislikes,” and user comments varied widely across all sources of media. Exploratory correlation analysis suggests that the number of a video’s views, comments, likes, and dislikes are not correlated with quality.
Conclusion
Study findings suggest that MedDiet health promotion and education via YouTube has the potential to reach and inform clients; however, existing video content and quality varies significantly. Future intervention research focused on MedDiet should further examine possible predictors of high quality MedDiet content utilizing diverse online video sharing platforms.},

	abstract = {Social media culinary videos are a prominent feature across various social media platforms and constitute one of many media platforms that expose audiences to food. Given that there is a link between exposure to food content through food media and nutrient intake, our study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to social media culinary videos on adolescents’ appetites. We conducted a pre- and posttest study with 126 middle school children (Mage = 13.9, SD = 1.2). Participants saw a social media culinary video either demonstrating the preparation of a sweet snack (n = 50) or a fruit and vegetable snack (n = 76). As dependent variables, we examined hunger, general desire to eat, liking of the foods portrayed, intentions to eat and prepare the portrayed foods, and actual food choice behavior. The findings showed that the videos had no effects on hunger or general desire to eat but influenced food choice behavior, liking of the foods, and intentions to eat and prepare the foods portrayed. The sweet snacks video reduced the liking of fruits and vegetables and indirectly reduced the odds of choosing a fruit over a cookie, through intentions to eat sweet snacks. The fruits and vegetables video reduced the liking of sweet snacks and resulted in higher intentions to prepare healthy snacks. In conclusion, a single exposure to short-form culinary videos had effects on various food-related outcomes. While the positive effects of the fruits and vegetable video frame these videos as potential platforms to stimulate healthy eating and food preparation, the effects of the sweet snacks video warn of negative influences. Further research on prolonged repetitive exposure is warranted.},

Additionally, a validated framework developed from criteria established in both editions of the Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population was employed. Recipes for cakes and baked goods, puddings, snacks and homemade fast foods, which were among the most frequently posted, contained the lowest proportion of unprocessed/minimally processed ingredients and the highest proportion of ultra-processed ingredients. Recipes containing whole cereals, fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds were scarce. Results indicate that users should be critical about the quality of recipes shared on YouTube® videos, also indicating a need for strategies aimed at informing individuals on how to choose healthier recipes or adapt them to become healthier.},

Food influencers, for example, frequently feature home cooking, a healthier behavior compared to snacking or dining out. This study explored the potential of social media influencers in promoting such behavior. Driven by social cognitive theory, we explored whether self-efficacy, perceived benefits, and concerns (social, entertainment, health, and economic) relate to the intention of the audience to cook at home following the recipes an Instagram influencer provides. We conducted three separate studies (two surveys and one experiment) with a French population of social network platform users. Our results showed that the entertainment value of an observed behavior is the main driver for imitation on social media, along with self-efficacy, at least for women. Mixed results were obtained for social benefits. The perceived ease of the recipe, cooking experience, and explicit verbal encouragement were positively related to self-efficacy. Surprisingly, the effect of health and economic benefits or concerns and labeling was not confirmed.},

	abstract = {The association between social media (SM) and children's and adolescents' diet is poorly understood. This systematic literature review aims to explore the role of SM in children's and adolescents' diets and related behaviors, considering also the underlying mechanisms. We searched Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL (2008–December 2021) for studies assessing the relation of SM exposure with food intake, food preference, dietary behaviors, and the underlying mechanisms (e.g., brain activation to digital food images—as proxy for SM food images) among healthy children and adolescents aged 2–18 y. A total of 35 articles were included. Of 4 studies, 1 found that exposure to peers' videos on healthy eating, but not SM influencers', increased vegetable intake. Most studies reported that SM was associated with skipping breakfast, increased intake of unhealthy snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages, and lower fruit and vegetable intake, independent of age. Children and adolescents exposed to unhealthy compared with healthy digital food images showed increased brain response in reward- and attention-related regions. The mechanisms underpinning the abovementioned associations were 1) physiological (appetitive state, increased neural response to portion size and energy density of food depicted) and 2) social (food advertising via SM influencers and peers). SM exposure leads to unfavorable eating patterns both in children and adolescents. The identified mechanisms may help tailor future health interventions. Downregulating SM advertising and limiting SM exposure to children and adolescents may improve food intake and subsequent health outcomes. The protocol of this review was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42020213977 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/).},

	abstract = {Recently, researchers have started investigating the influence of eating-focused social media content on viewers’ body image and eating behaviour. The current systematic review collates the evidence for the relationship between exposure to eating-related social media content and people’s body image, disordered eating, food consumption, and eating-related opinions. Following PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted on five databases (i.e., Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest), resulting in 38 eligible studies that examined the link between eating-related content and body image, eating behaviour and/or viewers’ perceptions. Evidence showed positive relationships between exposure to certain material on social media (e.g., fast-food advertisements, clean eating, eating videos) and body image concerns, disordered eating, and consumption of, or a willingness to consume the foods seen on social media; however, studies that focused on ‘healthy food’ content showed no such link. Viewers expressed mixed feelings towards content such as nutrition information and mukbang videos which record hosts eating a large amount of food. Future research would benefit from a consistent measure of exposure to different eating-related content. There is also a need for more experimental research to examine the impact of watching different types of eating videos on body image, disordered eating, and food consumption.},

	abstract = {Background: The influence of social media among adolescent peer groups can be a powerful change agent.
Objective: Our scoping review aimed to elucidate the ways in which social media use among adolescent peers influences eating behaviors.
Methods: A scoping review of the literature of articles published from journal inception to 2019 was performed by searching PubMed (ie, MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and other databases. The review was conducted in three steps: (1) identification of the research question and clarification of criteria using the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) framework; (2) selection of articles from the literature using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines; and (3) charting and summarizing information from selected articles. PubMed’s Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Embase’s Emtree subject headings were reviewed along with specific keywords to construct a comprehensive search strategy. Subject headings and keywords were based on adolescent age groups, social media platforms, and eating behaviors. After screening 1387 peer-reviewed articles, 37 articles were assessed for eligibility. Participant age, gender, study location, social media channels utilized, user volume, and content themes related to findings were extracted from the articles.
Results: Six articles met the final inclusion criteria. A final sample size of 1225 adolescents (aged 10 to 19 years) from the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Brazil, and Australia were included in controlled and qualitative studies. Instagram and Facebook were among the most popular social media platforms that influenced healthful eating behaviors (ie, fruit and vegetable intake) as well as unhealthful eating behaviors related to fast food advertising. Online forums served as accessible channels for eating disorder relapse prevention among youth. Social media influence converged around four central themes: (1) visual appeal, (2) content dissemination, (3) socialized digital connections, and (4) adolescent marketer influencers.
Conclusions: Adolescent peer influence in social media environments spans the spectrum of healthy eating (ie, pathological) to eating disorders (ie, nonpathological). Strategic network-driven approaches should be considered for engaging adolescents in the promotion of positive dietary behaviors.},

Most existing studies focused on video creators, leaving the motivations and practices of viewers underexplored. We interviewed 18 participants, surveyed 121 respondents, and derived a model characterizing consumers' video consumption practices on social media. The practices include five main activities: deciding to watch videos driven by various motivations, accessing videos on social media through a socio-technical ecosystem, watching videos to meet informational, emotional, and entertainment needs, evaluating the credibility and interestingness of videos, and using videos to achieve health goals. Through an iterative video consumption process, individuals strategically navigate across multiple platforms, seeking better accessibility, higher reliability, and cultivating a stronger motivation. They actively look for longer and more in-depth videos. We further identified challenges consumers face while consuming health videos on social media and discussed design implications and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Videos and podcasts have become popular in nutrition communication. However, it is unclear whether they are more effective than online texts in conveying knowledge and promoting behavioural intentions. Based on the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, it was hypothesised that videos are more effective than podcasts or texts in communicating nutrition-related information. In addition, differences in behaviour change intentions were explored. The pre-registered online experiment used a 3 (medium: video, podcast and text) × 3 (topic: diet and climate change, sugar content, and nudging) between-subjects design with 320 participants who were randomly assigned to the conditions. After receiving the respective content, the participants' intention to change their behaviour accordingly and their knowledge about all topics were assessed. A mixed Analysis of Variance revealed a significant interaction of topic and knowledge, indicating that knowledge was higher for the topic that participants were assigned to, compared to the two topics they received no information about. There were no differences in knowledge or intention for the three media. Videos, podcasts and texts are equally suitable for conveying nutrition knowledge and may also be equally beneficial for promoting intention. Communicators may thus base their choice of medium on considerations like available resources and preferences of the target group.},

	abstract = {Latines are the fastest growing populace in the United States. Latine is a new, inclusive term for Hispanic and Latino populations regardless of gender identity. When compared with non-Latine counterparts, Latines have higher prevalence rates of obesity, diabetes, chronic liver disease, and kidney disease, which are associated with poor dietary behaviors. More research is warranted into the factors behind Latines’ understanding of nutrition and potential sources of health information that influence dietary behaviors. This study describes the nutrition-related health information shared through YouTube by English-speaking Latine individuals between the ages of 18 and 49. For this content analysis, a cross-sectional study design was used. A four-step search strategy identified eligible YouTube channels and their corresponding video blogs (vlogs): discovery, screening, eligibility, and included. NVivo 1.0 was used to qualitatively code the nutrition-related information. A total of 68 vlogs were identified and reviewed. Five main themes emerged from the data (what vloggers discussed): Nutrition Philosophies, Inaccurate Information, Product Promotion, Recommendations based on the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), and Recommendations not based on the 2020–2025 DGA. Although some of the nutrition-related information shared followed the 2020–2025 DGA, not all information were in line with these guidelines. Misinformation can undermine the scientific work done by health professionals and can threaten the health and lives of the citizenry by creating barriers for accessing, understanding, and utilizing evidenced-informed guidance in making health decisions. This study revealed that more research is warranted into specific aspects of social media and how they influence health behavior.},

	abstract = {With young adults (18–30 years) having low vegetable intake, primarily due to inadequate cooking skills, this study aims to explore the usability and desirability of educational tools, such as written recipes and cooking videos, to foster sustainable eating habits. Employing a descriptive, qualitative, and user-centered design, three focus groups were held at a major urban university campus in New Zealand, engaging students and staff within the target age group. Discussions with 15 participants identified key facilitators of vegetable-based cooking, including access to ingredients, ease of recipe visualization, and cost-effectiveness. Consequently, 13 vegetable-centric recipes and instructional videos were created, incorporating nutritional value, affordability, and preparation efficiency. These resources, tailored to young adults’ preferences, were designed to mitigate the identified barriers to vegetable use, contributing to sustainable food practices. The application of a user-centered approach in developing educational content yielded a set of recipes and videos that not only address the gaps in cooking skills among young adults but also promote the broader goals of sustainability in food consumption patterns. This approach offers actionable insights for practitioners and food marketers to enhance vegetable utilization and sustainable eating behaviors in this demographic.},
